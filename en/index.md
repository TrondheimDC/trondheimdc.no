TDC is a non-profit conference where any potential surplus is used to support the following year’s conference and events in Trondheim organised by various tech communities. For example, we use funds to provide venues for meetups, and the conference statutes explicitly state that the event should contribute to enabling further growth in the IT community in the Trondheim region through talks, meetings, and networking.
